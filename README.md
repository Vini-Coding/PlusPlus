The **Plus+** application is an application designed to **improve management capacity in establishments**. Its main functionality is to display a real-time **counter** on the screen, which can be incremented when a customer enters the establishment, and decremented when a customer leaves the establishment. When the capacity limit is reached, Plus+ notifies the user that the place has reached the maximum possible capacity and blocks the Enter button.
- The user must set the capacity limit and can optionally add a background photo of his establishment or product.
- When leaving the application, the data of the capacity limit and image of backgrounds set by the user will be saved.
- The app even has Getting Started Screens for the first use.
